# Classification-Pyspark
This repository of classification template using pyspark.

In this part, I tried to make a template of classification in machine learning using pyspark. I will try to explain step by step from load data, data cleansing and making prediction. I created some functions in pyspark to make an automatization, so users just need to update or replace the dataset.

In general, the steps of classification in machine learning are:

* Load Data into Spark Dataframe.

* Check the data.

* Define categorical and numerical variables.

* Sample data
   If the dataset is too large, we can take sample of data. 
   Note: this step is optional.
* Check Missing Values.

* Handle Missing Values.

* Compare categorical variables in data train and data test.

* EDA 
  Create distribution visualization in each variables to get some insight of dataset.
  
* Handle insignificant categories in data train.

* Handle insignificant categories in data test.

* Handle outlier.

* Future Engineering.

* Split Data train to train and test.

* Modelling.

* Evaluation.

* Hyper-Parameter Tuning.
